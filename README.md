# MetaMapper

MetaMapper can be used to process (jpg & tif) images in the current directory or a subdirectory, based on the creation date.
It will create folders based on `year`, `year-month`, and `year-month-day` in the current directory or a given subdirectory.

Will be useful in the case of recovered photos (photorec)


##Dependencies:

* EXIF lib is used and included in this repository, which supports tiff and jpeg
* Dateutil
