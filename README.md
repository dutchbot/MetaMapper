# MetaMapper

MetaMapper can be used to process (jpeg) images in the current directory or a subdirectory, based on the creation date.
It will create folders based on `year`, `year-month`, and `year-month-day` in the current directory or a given subdirectory.

Python EXIF lib was used, which supports tiff and jpeg, this tool only supports jpeg (jpg hardcoded) at the moment.
